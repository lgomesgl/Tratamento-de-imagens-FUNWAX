# Tratamento de imagens - FUNWAX

This project have images with crystals. 
Start to found the crystals using the library open-cv.

* Acronyms in scripts
    * AR: Aspect ratio of crystal
    * Reynolds: Reynolds Number
    * Type: Type of crystal
    * 

# main.py
    * Input: the folder path of the images. 

# classfication_crystal.py
    * Receive the each image and found, through filters and functions from open-cv, the crystals.
    * Create the database with all crystals.

# test_filers.py
    * A script to test many filters to applied to the image in classification_crystal.py

# pos_processing.py
    * Analyse the database generated by clasification_crystal.py
    * Some graphics in script:
        1: AR x Reynolds, hue = Type
        2: AR x Reynolds, hue = Toil
        3: AR x Reynolds, hue = Tcool
        4: AR x Time, hue = Type
        5: Distribution of AR
        6: N of crystals x Reynolds, hue = Type
        7: N of crystals x Reynolds, hue = Toil
        8: N of crystals x Reynolds, hue = Tcool
        9: N of crystal x Time, hue = Type

## Major & Minor is equal to zero. Why??
